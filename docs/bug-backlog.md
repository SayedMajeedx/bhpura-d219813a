# Bug Backlog

Real bugs found during the maintainability refactors (Phases 4–5). Refactors must preserve behaviour, so these were **recorded, not fixed**. Fix each in its own small PR with a test that fails before the fix.

When you fix one, delete its entry (the PR is the record). When a refactor finds a new one, add it here instead of fixing it in the refactor PR.

Line numbers are as of 2026-09-24 and may drift; search for the quoted code.

## Orders (`src/routes/_authenticated/admin.b.$slug.orders.$id.tsx`, `src/features/orders/`)

### 14. Courier "delivered" writes twice, and its fallback cannot write

- **Where**: `src/components/orders/CourierOrderView.tsx`, `updateStatus("delivered")`.
- **Problem**: after `courier_update_delivery` succeeds, the view still sends a direct `orders` update, with `payment_status` computed from `Math.max(orderTotal, …)` (always "paid") and `fulfillment_status: "COMPLETED"` over the RPC's `delivered`. Couriers have no UPDATE policy on `orders`, so that update is filtered out silently: when the RPC fails, the "fallback" never writes either. `codConfirmed || true` is always true.
- **Fix**: rely on the RPC alone for couriers (it already checks the assignment and the cash due), surface its errors (`COD_AMOUNT_MISMATCH`, `COD_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED`), and drop the direct update and the `|| true`.
